# Gemini Exfil Detector

AI-Assisted Insider Threat Detection for Google Workspace

Detects when users leverage Gemini AI to analyze sensitive files ("recon") and then immediately share or exfiltrate them ("exfil")â€”a high-signal insider risk pattern.

**Note:** This is released as a proof-of-concept detection. Test thoroughly in your environment before production deployment.

## What It Catches

The **LLM-aided "read-then-share" pattern** that insiders use to rapidly understand and move sensitive documents:

1. **Recon Step**: User invokes Gemini to summarize, analyze, or ask questions about a Drive file
2. **Exfil Step**: Within a short time window, the same user:
   - Changes file sharing to external/public
   - Downloads or exports the file  
   - Copies the file to an externally-shared folder
   - Modifies permissions to grant external access

This correlation produces a **high-signal insider-risk detector** without reading any user content.

### Advanced Detection Capabilities

**Multi-Stage Attack Detection**: Tracks cumulative reconnaissance activity with time-decay scoring to catch sophisticated insiders who wait days between recon and exfil (outside immediate correlation windows).

**File Sensitivity Context**: Enriches findings with file metadata (labels, ownership, sharing history) to prioritize high-sensitivity documents and reduce false positives.

**Intent Classification**: Uses behavioral analysis to distinguish malicious exfil from legitimate workflows:
- Destination domain reputation (partner vs unknown)
- Historical sharing patterns per user
- File ownership analysis
- Off-hours detection

---

## Why It Works

Traditional DLP focuses on content. This detector focuses on behavioral sequence:

- **Gemini logs** reveal intent (what files the user wanted to understand)
- **Drive audit logs** reveal action (what the user did with those files)
- **Temporal correlation** reveals insider TTP

You won't get Gemini prompt/response content, but you will get:

- Precise actions (`ask_about_this_file`, `summarize_file`, `catch_me_up`)
- App context (docs, drive, sheets, slides)
- Reliable timestamps (to the second)
- Actor email and file IDs

Google's documentation positions these logs for security telemetry:

## Detection Logic

### Immediate Correlation
```
IF user_action IN {ask_about_this_file, summarize_file, analyze_documents, ...}
   AND app_name IN {docs, drive, sheets, slides}
   AND (within 0-30 minutes)
   AND same_user performs {change_visibility, download, export, add_external_acl, ...}
THEN alert(severity = HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
```

### Multi-Stage Detection
```
IF user has cumulative_recon_score > 5.0 (decays with 48hr half-life)
   AND user performs exfil action
   EVEN IF outside immediate time window
THEN alert(severity = MEDIUM, "Delayed exfil after cumulative recon")
```

### Intent Classification
```
IF destination_domain IN trusted_partners
   OR user shares own_files frequently
   OR historical_pattern matches current_behavior
THEN suppress OR downgrade severity
```

### Severity Rubric

| Severity | Criteria | Example | Response |
|----------|----------|---------|----------|
| **High** | External share or export within â‰¤10 min | Gemini summarizes financial doc â†’ exports to PDF 5 min later | Page on-call team |
| **Medium** | External share or export within 10-30 min | Gemini analyzes sheet â†’ changes sharing to "anyone with link" 15 min later | Next-day investigation |
| **Low** | Any permission change within 30 min | Gemini asks about doc â†’ moves to different folder 25 min later | Log for pattern analysis |

## Tuning

### Time Windows

```bash
# High-precision (fewer false positives)
python src/detector.py --config config.json --window-minutes 10

# Balanced (recommended)
python src/detector.py --config config.json --window-minutes 30

# High-recall (catches slow-burn exfil)
python src/detector.py --config config.json --window-minutes 60
```

### Recon Actions

**High-signal** (default):
- `ask_about_this_file` - Direct file query
- `summarize_file` - File summarization  
- `analyze_documents` - Multi-file analysis
- `catch_me_up` - Bulk triage

**Lower-signal** (may increase false positives):
- `help_me_write` - Content generation
- `proofread` - Grammar/spell check

### Suppression Rules

Add to config to reduce false positives:

```json
{
  "suppressions": {
    "security_investigation_ous": ["/Security"],
    "allowed_external_domains": ["partner.com"]
  }
}
```

**See [docs/TUNING.md](docs/TUNING.md) for comprehensive tuning guide.**

---

## Testing

Create a test scenario to verify detection:

1. **Create a test document** in Google Drive with sensitive-looking content
2. **Use Gemini** in Drive to ask "What is this document about?" or click "Summarize this file"
3. **Wait 2 minutes**
4. **Change sharing** to "Anyone with the link" or download the file
5. **Run detector**:
   ```bash
   python src/detector.py --config config.json --lookback-hours 1 --verbose
   ```
6. **Verify** a high-severity finding is generated

---

## Operational Metrics

Track these metrics for detector health:

- **True Positive Rate**: Confirmed insider incidents / Total findings
- **False Positive Rate**: Benign findings / Total findings  
- **Alert Volume**: Findings per day/week
- **API Success Rate**: Successful fetches / Total attempts
- **Coverage**: Unique actors with Gemini activity / Total users

---

## Built-In Advanced Features

### âœ… Multi-Stage Attack Detection
Tracks cumulative recon score with 48-hour decay half-life. Detects delayed exfil (Day 1: recon, Day 3: exfil).

### âœ… File Sensitivity Context
Enriches findings with file labels, ownership, and sharing history. Elevates severity for confidential files.

### âœ… Intent Classification
Behavioral analysis with domain reputation, user baselines, file ownership, and off-hours detection.

## Future Extensions

### 1. Bulk Recon + Mass Exfil
Detect `catch_me_up` on entire folders followed by multiple downloads within 1 hour.

### 2. Web Search â†’ Exfil
Detect `search_web` feature usage (potential data leakage via web results) followed by sharing.

### 3. First-Ever Gemini Usage
Alert on first-time Gemini usage by admins or high-risk users followed by immediate sharing.

### 4. Context Mixing
Detect Gemini usage across multiple sensitive files from different OUs, suggesting reconnaissance.

## Security Best Practices

1. **Protect service account key**: Store in secrets manager (GCP Secret Manager, AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)
2. **Least privilege**: Service account only has `admin.reports.audit.readonly` scope
3. **Rotate keys**: Rotate service account keys every 90 days
4. **Monitor the monitor**: Alert if detector stops running
5. **Audit access**: Log who can access the service account and config
